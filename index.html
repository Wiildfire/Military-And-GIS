     <h3 id="1"><u>What Is GIS?</u></h3>
    <p> A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. GIS can show many different kinds of data on one map. This enables people to more easily see, analyze, and understand patterns and relationships.</p>

    <h3 id="2"><u>What is it most useful for?</u></h3>
    <p> There are many different ways you can apply GIS in our world. Whether itâ€™s determining the elevation of the land or sea level to locating different locations or cities. More technological upgrades to it have allowed it to track packages and even mail. There is a lot more ways to use GIS other than that

    <h3 id="3"><u>How does the military use GIS?</u></h3>
    <p> How military uses GIS to cross reference. The GIS is really important to the military, helping them communicate, control and command. It gives them the advantage. The Military uses GIS in a lot of different ways like cartography, intelligence, battlefield management, terrain analysis, remote sensing, military installation management and monitoring possible terrorist activity.

    <h3 id="4"><u>How does it help military operations?</u></h3>
    <p> Terrain Evaluation in land based military operations helps out military field commanders so they would know the terrain condition, elevations for armor carriers, tanks and weapons. It also helps them utilize the resources that are available. GIS helps land based operations by helping create a detailed map of the land. This is vital information for the field commanders. The Ministry of Defense in any country gathers data on routing, filtering, analyzing and presenting information for making decisions

    <h3 id="5"><u>What are other military uses for GIS?</u></h3>
    <p> The uses of GIS for Artillery. An important part for adding GIS to artillery are: detecting probable locations of important targets of enemy force groupings; planning to employ MF & A reconnaissance forces and other assets (selecting the locations of deployment line) based on the field of reconnaissance asset and systems, prep for UAV flights using projections of panoramic-view images onto EMT to help find the coordinates of the detected targets to change the direction of the artillery units. The identification of portions of terrain where important enemy targets are most probably located happens layer by layer through consecutive exclusion of areas where targets being looked for cannot be located.
